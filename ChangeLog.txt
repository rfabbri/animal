	 + Fast Euclidean distance transform with exact label propagation (Maurer 2003
	 algorithm)

0.16.0
	 + Fast Euclidean distance transform algorithm now has a specialized algorithm
	 for computing the DT up to a given maximum distance. This is an updated
	 version of cuisenaire pmn, arguably the best available algorithm for this.

0.15.5
	 + Converted to Git
	 + Fixed "/bin/install: will not overwrite just-created" type bugs,
	 by removing repeated files in Makefile.am

0.15.4
	 + Renamed global variable in distmap-cuisenaire.c to avoid linker errors on
	 some systems such as Mac OS X.

0.15.3
	 + Removed nested function in distmaps.c, enhancing portability.

0.15.2
	 + Should also compile with recent Imagemagick (tested up to 6.5.x)

0.15.1
	 + Fixed Cuisenaire's algorithm. It is now exact. Other minor changes.

0.15.0
	 + Added meijster's algorithm; optimized maurer a little. 

0.14.3
	 + last version before CVS

0.14.2
   + Lotufo-Zampirolli's euclidean distance transform recoded, 2nd part 
   improved by reducing the number of function calls and using
   pointers more intelligently.  However, readability was sacrificed.

0.14.1
   + changes to the build system

0.14.0
   + new rgb2hsv and hsv2rgb functions in util.c
   + fixed drawline for angles between 90 and 135 degrees
   + no warnings of implicit ints with GCC

0.13.1 PATCH Release
   +  Should now compile on 64-bit systems. Tested under a DEC-Alpha 
   and eliminated a small bug in gandalf's misc_defs.h 

0.13.0
   + ELIMINATED THE DEPENDENCE ON GANDALF; this dependency gave
   way too much trouble for nothing; it is too hard to build and
   yet we use just a small part of it. We also started to merge
   Gandalf into Animal.
   + INCOMPATIBILITIES: All programs based on a previous Animal will
   have to change calls from gan_err_* to animal_err_* and GAN_ERR_TRACE
   to ANIMAL_ERR_TRACE. They also don't need to link against Gandalf anymore.

0.12.2
   + now works with ImageMagick 6, in spite of a bug in this version of
   ImageMagick. We still recommend ImageMagick 5.5.7, but older versions 
   down to 5.4.2 will also do.
   + using up-to-date libtool 1.5.6, autoconf 2.59, and automake 1.8.5

0.12.1
   + added imwrite function to write images in ANY commercial format.
   + Simple ASCII image file format for reading and
   writing images with too much pixel depth (32 and 64bit) in a
   portable way. see img_g.c_incl file, function imread_ascii.
   Compression is supported under unix-like systems.
   + Fixed error in Saito's Euclidean Distance Transform to work
   with maximum distance and with non-square images
   + added -lXi flag to the compilation libraries. This is needed by -lglut.

0.12.0
   + New Egger's fast Exact Euclidean Distance Transform by propagation.
   + Fixed error in Saito that was present in Cuisenaire's implementation.
   Namely, the method was not working for non-square images.

0.11.0
   + New Saito & Toriwaki's fast Exact Euclidean Distance Transform.

0.10.10 (not released)
   + Cuisenaire's algorithm now works for larger images
   + New Routines for generating error table value for Cuisenaire's Fast
   Euclidean Distance Transform algorithm

0.10.9
   + bugfix in IFT, which affects Distance Transforms, Watershed,
   and more.
   + bugfix in Cuisenaire's PMON method for Euclidean Distance Map

0.10.8
   + thx to Dean S. Messing: I added src/Makefile.am and
   src/Makefile.in to the distro, which were missing in the previous
   version due to my mistake with Automake. -- Ricardo.
   + fixed bug in Cuisenaire's Euclidean Distance Tranform
   + imshow now works normally for constant images; default scaling
   is now done considering the range of each image pixel type. 

0.10.7
   + If you have a GNU/Linux system, the fastest way to compile animal
   is to use --disable-shared and CFLAGS="-pipe": 
      CFLAGS="-pipe" ./configure --disable-shared 
   + Compilation is more than 4x faster because examples are not built
   by default anymore. 
   + New gprof support by configure
   + New Penthium 4 optimization may now be enabled by provinding the
   --enable-opt=p4 argument to configure. May result in 3x speedup.
   + Improved Gandalf detection. Work-around for the OpenGL bug with 
   static Animal
   + Removed some example images to decrease the package size
   + Removed 'dt-comparison' example

0.10.6
   + now compiles with Gandalf 1.3.2. Many systems have a spoiled
   OpenGL library that defines some never-used symbols. Looks like
   some NVIDIA OpenGL drivers are affected by this, so you can't
   compile GLUT applications on them. This affects Slackware 9.1,
   RedHat 9.0, and many more. The fix took long as it wasn't easy.

0.10.5
   + fixed memleaks in Maurer and Cuisenaire's distance map methods.

0.10.4
   + configure script now discards checks for round but also checks 
   ImageMagick more thoroughly.

0.10.3
   + removed requirement for a GNU compiler. More specifically,
   no use is made of the C99 round function, so that the code is now more
   portable. (removed AC_GNU_SOURCE from configure.ac)

0.10.2
   + Compiles also with Gandalf 1.3.2, as well as earlier versions 
   down to Gandalf 1.1.

0.10.1
   + Optimized EDT by IFT (image foresting transform)
   + Optimized EDT by exact dilations. Although slow, this method
   is exact allows you to have full controll over the value of the distance
   to be calculated. 
   + Behaviour of Euclidean distance tranfom functions is now uniform:
   they calculate distance values for every foreground pixel ("1"). To get an
   external DT, simply invert the image. To get both internal and external DT,
   first find the binary border of the object, invert it, and finally run the
   distance transform.
   + INCOMPATIBILITIES: in file distmaps.h: 
     - DT_COSTA_ESTROZI algorithm type changed to DT_EXACT_DILATIONS, 
     - distance_tranform function has no "side" parameter anymore
   + Error treatment is better in many routines
   + C Bool type is now detected by autoconf or correctly substituted if
   missing.

0.10.0
   + New state-of-the-art Euclidean Distance Transform algorithm
   (Cuisenaire 1999), which is probably the best, together with
   Maurer's 2003 algorithm.

0.9.0
   + New state-of-the-art Euclidean Distance Transform algorithm 
   (Maurer PAMI feb. 2003), which is much faster than all previous algorithms.
   See files animal/distmaps.h and  src/distmaps.c
   + Distance transform algorithms moved to file distmaps.c

0.8.0
   + New function label_components that labels connected components in a
   binary image. See the example program "src/label_components.c".
   + imfill has a new neighborhood parameter
   + pstk (pixel stack) now uses gandalf error treatment
   + Many minor fixes and improvements
   + New example programs in src dir

0.7.4
   + minor fixes

0.7.3
   + The building procedure was updated with the trio autoconf 2.58, 
   automake 1.8 and libtool 1.5

0.7.2
   + fixed bug in watershed. Markers were not handled correctly.

0.7.1
   + fixed a bug in bwdist (Lotufo-Zampirolli EDT implementation)
   regarding a mysterious black line on the top of the image.

0.7.0
   + Fast Watershed transform by IFT (function watershed in morphology.h)
   + Regional minima detection by IFT (regional_minima in morphology.h)
   + IFT procedures and framework were rewritten. They are more general.
   One may readily implement many image processing operators using it,
   specially segmentation operators.
   + In file analysis.c we changed the way propagation functions are called
   (parameters, etc).
   + Many bugfixes to the propagation routines, which affects euclidean
   distance transforms and multiscale skeletonization.
   + Error treatment has been improved in some routines, by making use of
   lib Gandalf's error treatment scheme. 

0.6.2
   + enum types are now used for algorithm selection such as
   DT_LOTUFO_ZAMPIROLLI and such.
   + fixes to distance_tranform function (analysis.c)

0.6.1
   + Robust detection of Gandalf library in configure
   + --disable-debug flag added to configure, so the code gets faster by
   eliminating "assert" calls and some Gandalf debugging instructions.
   + minor INSTALL/README changes

0.6.0
   + New Lotufo-Zampirolli very efficient exact euclidean
   distance transform based on raster scans (1D erosions). See
   src/distance_transform.c for an example.
   + New static integer queue, useful in many fast algorithms.
   + autoreconf works without any errors.
   + started using Gandalf (gandalf-library.sourceforge.net) for error
   treatment. The configure script doesn't automatically check for this
   library YET.

0.5.0
   + new Zhang-Suen thinning (thinzs_np)
   + new crossing_index_np to measure how many connected components
     would be generated if a pixel would be erased
   + and nhcount_np to count the number of foreground pixels in a 
     neighborhood

0.4.5
   + works with ImageMagick 5.5.6

0.4.4
   + new animal-config script to eliminate the need for pkg-config
   for using animal.

0.4.3
   + minor improvements to build system

0.4.2
   + added necessary macros and configurations so that Animal generates
   DLL's on MinGW.

0.4.1
   + it is not allowed to compile with ImageMagick 5.5.5 (it has a bug
   which makes it unusable with AnImaL.)
   + src files are no more intalled into system. They are kept on src,
   only libtool-installed there.

0.4.0
   + Minor improvements to the build system

0.3.0 (20030301)
   + Improvements to the build system (configure.ac and Makefile.am's)
   + Improved detection of ImageMagick
   + pkg-config support

0.2.0  (20030227)
   + Uses libtool libraries to make library building more portable.
   + It is now possible to choose between static and shared libs

0.1.0 Initial release
   + Many routines (see animal/*.h)
   + I/O of image files in almost ANY format, using
   ImageMagick 5.4.2
   + home page
